# WCR Repositoryâ„¢

This bitbucket repository builds a research data repository based on the [Fedora](http://fedorarepository.org/)/[Samvera](http://samvera.org/)/[Hyrax](http://hyr.ax/) platform. 

---

DRUW is based on Hyrax 2 (alpha) which has installation requirements and instructions detailed in the Hyrax Project's [README](https://github.com/samvera/hyrax). Or, if you are familiar with Vagrant, the [druw-infrastructure repo](https://github.com/UW-Libraries/druw-infrastructure) should help create a centos 7 based, Ruby/Rails environment.

Git workflow can be found in this repo's wiki: https://github.com/UW-Libraries/druw/wiki/Git_Workflow_and_Notes
