/* 
   Use this file to create any SASS variables to be used in our custom CSS.
   
   Note that you can override the values of other SASS variables from 
   Bootstrap, Sufia, etc. by defining them here first. SASS uses the value
   for a variable when it is first declared. Subsequent declarations do 
   not change the value.
