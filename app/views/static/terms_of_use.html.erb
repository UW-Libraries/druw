        <%= t('sufia.product_name') %></abbr> is a stand-alone permission. 
        Materialsâ€™ availability does not imply that they may be used in any 
        way the accessor wishes; apart from <a href="null">fair use</a>, the 
        intellectual property owner (often the author) of the materials has 
        the right to dictate the terms of use - including whether users can 
        copy and distribute the material. <%= t('sufia.product_name') %> requires 
        all depositors to indicate their wishes for these terms, often by 
        assigning a license to the materials. This information is recorded 
        in the metadata that accompanies each file. Usually the terms will 
        fall under one of four categories:

    <p> While <%= t('sufia.product_name') %> is committed to supporting the 
        forthcoming <a href="null">UW Policy on Open Access</a>, some of the 
        materials in <%= t('sufia.product_name') %> Archive are under a 
        limited-time embargo. If you would like to use the material before the 
        embargo period ends, you must contact the author to obtain express 
        permission. See our <a href="null">Data Citation Guide</a> for 
        attribution and citation best practices, and our 
        <a href="null">Copyright FAQ</a> for more information on intellectual 
        property rights. If you have any questions about how an item in
